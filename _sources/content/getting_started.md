# Getting Started

## Request a Hub

If you need a hub configured for your institution or would like to set up a
meeting, please open a
[github issue](https://github.com/cal-icor/cal-icor-hubs/issues/new?template=new_hub_request.yml)!

## JupyterHub

Your institution's hub address will look like this:
**\<institution\>.jupyter.cal-icor.org**

## Authentication and User Management

The hub does not require any user management. Anyone from your institution can
authenticate using the authentication method that best suits your needs,
including using your institution's email address as an account.

## File Storage

Each user has unlimited file storage.  Files and accounts will be removed from
the service after three years of inactivity.  Cal-ICOR will monitor disk usage
and will notify users if they are using excessive disk space.

## Costs

This is a free service intended for California Educational Institutions.
