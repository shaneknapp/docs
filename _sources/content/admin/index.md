# Administrator Guide

This section is intended for administrators of the CAL-ICOR JupyterHub
deployment. It contains information on managing the system, user accounts, and
other administrative tasks.

These documents are heavily based on the
[UC Berkeley Datahub documentation](https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/), which
is the inspiration for the CAL-ICOR JupyterHub deployment.
