## Acceptable Use Policy

This policy does not supercede or nullify any part of the Acceptable Use
Policies that apply to your community (e.g., Institution Acceptable Use
Policies).  In addition you must comply with the policies and guidelines for
any specific set of resources to which you have been granted access (e.g., 
policies from Cloud Providers).

When other policies that you are bound by are more restrictive than this
policy, the more restrictive policy takes precedence.

As an Authorized User of Cal-ICOR Managed Infrastructure, you are expected to:
- Use only the Cal-ICOR Managed Infrastructure and accounts for which you have
  authorization.
- Not store, process or transmit any sensitive data (e.g., grades, personally
  identifiable information, protected health information, etc.).  If you are
  unsure whether the data you are using is sensitive, please contact your
  Institution Representative or Cal-ICOR staff.
- Not use another individual's account, or attempt to capture or guess other
  users' passwords.  You may not enable unauthorized users to access
  infrastructure managed by Cal-ICOR by providing them access to your account.
- Be individually responsible for appropriate use of all resources
  provided to you, including your interactive computing session, networking
  infrastructure on your hub, and the software and hardware you use.
- Comply with and contractual and licence agreements that Cal-ICOR is bound to
  respecting certain third party resources.
- Make a reasonable effort to protect your passwords and to secure resources
  against unauthorized use or access.  Where applicable you must configure
  access to other cloud services or data in a way that reasonably prevents
  unauthorized users from accessing them.
- Not attempt to access restricted portions of the network or any Cal-ICOR
  Managed Infrastructure without appropriate authorization by a Cal-ICOR staff
  member.
- Not attempt to use Cal-ICOR Managed Infrastructure for the purposes of
  [mining cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency#Mining)
  unless explicitly given permission by your Institution Representitive *and*
  Cal-ICOR staff for research purposes.
- Not deliberately perform acts that waste computer resources or
  unfairly monopolize resources to the exclusion of others.  Cal-ICOR Managed
  Infrastructure resources are not unlimited.  Network bandwidth and storage
  capacity have finite limits, and all users connected to the network have a
  responsibility to conserve these resources.
- Not use Cal-ICOR Managed Infrastructure and/or network resources in
  conjunction with the execution of programs, software, processes, or automated
  transaction-based commands that are intended to disrupt (or that could
  reasonably be expected to disrupt) other computer or network users, or damage
  or degrade performance, software or hardware components of a system.
- Not use the Cal-ICOR Managed Infrastructure to distribute or facilitate the
  sending of unsolicited or unlawful (i) email or other messages, or (ii)
  promotions of any kind;
- Not use the Cal-ICOR Managed Infrastructure to engage in or promote any other
  fraudulent, deceptive or illegal activities.

  material, including any Customer Data, in violation of any Law or any third
  party rights, including without limitation privacy rights;
- Not use the Cal-ICOR Managed Infrastructure in any circumstances where failure
  could lead to death, personal injury or environmental damage, and you further
  acknowledge that the Cal-ICOR Managed Infrastructure is not designed or intended
  for such use.
