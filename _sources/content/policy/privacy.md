## Summary

Cal-ICOR does not store or retains and personally identifiable information
about its partners or users, or the information that is created or placed on
the Infrastructure we run.

Access to the Cal-ICOR Managed Infrastructure is required by Cal-ICOR staff,
but if a partnered Institution stops working with Cal-ICOR the information and
access is not retained.

## While partnered with an Institution

We do not retain or share any information as described below:

- Cal-ICOR will require access to the Cal-ICOR Managed Infrastructure of a
  partnered Institution, including but not limited to all filesystems and
  servers for general maintenance and debugging.
- Cal-ICOR staff could potentially have access to personally-identifiable
  information used for _authenticating_ users, e.g. an email address for
  logins.
- User data on a Cal-ICOR Managed Infrastructure deployment will never be
  intentionally changed or deleted, unless:
  - The partnership with the Institution has ended and the Cal-ICOR Managed
    Infrastructure is no longer in use.
  - We have explicit permission from the Institution to delete the data.
- Some data will be consumed by our monitoring and metrics for the purpose of
  alerting staff to potential issues with a deployment as well as usage
  statistics.

## After a partnership with an Institution ends

- When an Institution and Cal-ICOR end their partnership, all information and
  data that was contained within that partner's Cal-ICOR Managed Infrastructure
  will be deleted.  This includes:
  - All user data, including but not limited to notebooks, files, and
    configurations.
  - All user accounts, including but not limited to the email addresses used
    for authentication.
- The Cloud Inmfrastructure will be deleted, and all access to the
  infrastructure will be removed.
- If the Institution has a new partner or Cloud Provider, the data can
  potentially be transferred to the new partner or Cloud Provider.
  - This request must be made by the Institution Representative, and 
    Cal-ICOR staff will work with the Institution to transfer the data.
  - This will be done in a secure manner, and all data will be deleted from
    the Cal-ICOR Managed Infrastructure.
  - If amount of data is large, the transfer may take some time or not be
    possible.
