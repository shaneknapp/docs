# Notebooks and Material Sharing

We showcase Jupyter Notebook-based courses that highlight interactive and data-driven learning. Our goal is to build a collaborative community where educators contribute, share, and refine courses designed around Jupyter notebooks. By fostering an open and supportive environment, we aim to make high-quality, interactive learning materials more accessible and widely available.

Our current courses and documentation related to creating Jupyter notebooks are found [here](https://cal-icor.github.io/textbook/intro.html).
