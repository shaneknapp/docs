## The Big Picture

The JupyterHub deployments are addressing various challenges in teaching Data and Computer Science:

- **Consistent versions and environments** ensure every student works with the same package/library versions.
- **Consistent processing power and memory** eliminate dependency on studentsâ€™ personal computer configurations.
- **No configuration required by students**, allowing them to access materials and start working immediately.
- **Authentication via your institution's credentials**, avoiding the need for separate accounts.
- **Streamlined material distribution** for easy and reliable access.
- **Persistent student storage**, removing the need for constant downloads of work.

## JupyterHub Configuration

The JupyterHub is tied to your institution:  
`<institution>.jupyter.cal-icor.org`

The following is provided:

- **Custom Environment (Docker image):** You can maintain your own image or use ours. This image defines the compute environment students use.
- **Computing Resources:** By default, each user is allocated 1 CPU and 2 GB of memory. These limits can be customized as needed.
- **Development Tools:**
  - JupyterLab (with Python and R kernels)
  - VSCode
  - RStudio
  - Shiny
  - Terminal access, enabling students to run scripts outside of an IDE

- **Language Support:**
  - Python
  - R
  - C++
