# Authentication  

We offer multiple authentication options to accommodate different institutional setups.  

## CILogon

Our primary authentication method is [CILogon](https://www.cilogon.org/faq), a service operated by the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois.  

Many higher education institutions are already registered with CILogon, making authentication straightforward if your school is listed.  

## Microsoft or Google  

For institutions that use **Google** or **Microsoft** as their identity provider, CILogon can integrate with these services for seamless authentication.  

## GitHub  

If your institution does not support CILogon authentication, we can configure a [GitHub organization](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/about-organizations) for you. This allows you to manage authentication through GitHub.
